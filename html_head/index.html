  <p>Charmander was saved from a fire before I rescued him from the Sand Springs Animal Shelter. He's basically a sour patch kid, first he's sour then he's sweet!</p>
  
  <h3>Why I Chose Atlas</h3>
  <p>I stumbled upon Atlas while scrolling through the internet one day and decided to make the leap into full-stack development. During Covid, I downloaded an app called, "Mimo", and replaced doom scrolling with this app and loved it.</p>
